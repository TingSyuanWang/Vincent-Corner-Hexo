&emsp;&emsp;Because of the rainy days, I didn’t go to visit the potted plants on the balcony for several days. Today, I went out to look and I feel surprised. One of them had been in critical conditions and leaves covered the ground. However, an unknown plant grow lush at it side and swayed proudly in the wind. One kind of sadness instantly came up from my mind. I blamed my carelessness, but also lamented the fragile of potted plants. I urgently watered the potted plants, but I don’t know why I couldn’t eradicate that unknown alien plant.
&emsp;&emsp;What kind of conditions could make this life? Due to the lack of attention from me, my potted plants are gradually lost luster. However, it seized this gap and thrived itself. Yes, if I concerned in place, it might be removed when it was inconspicuous. After all, that is my potted plants world, this life didn’t belong to here will be eventually destroy the crafted beauty. But just a few days effort, it was no fear of lack of water and hold the opportunity to put itself look as tall as potted plants.
&emsp;&emsp;I looked on the potted plants in the verge of death, but also looked at that unknown plant. I was suddenly enlightened in the sadness and moved emotion: In fact, life is a kind of strong.
&emsp;&emsp;Isn’t it? Plant did it, life is also much better than this!
&emsp;&emsp;Life can be born, because the mother and baby are all strong.
&emsp;&emsp;Life comes from the strong. Life is inseparable from the strong.
&emsp;&emsp;Every day we are dependent with the strong. I think, if you can choose, no one wants to have pain, willing to be sad, even to be toil. But from the birth, we are inevitably deal with some ailment or even illness. Everyone wants to expose under the sun when woke up every day, listen to songs and see the sights every day. However, we haven’t be willing to get up by parent’s call since we were in small age. Then do the things we need to do, reading or working. These all rely on the strong.
&emsp;&emsp;There are no pure land on earth which can make us arbitrary. There is always a distance between dreams and realities. If the environment is unsatisfactory; if we are in sick and forsaken by lover; if life is too gloomy. Strong, it is the support of life.
&emsp;&emsp;We must be use the strong to face the tedious every day and stimulate the neglected and injured soul. The strong is necessary in life. It is the pillar of the spirit and the faith to across obstacles.
&emsp;&emsp;The unknown plant of the potted plants use the strong to touch me. I would leave it and have no regrets, because it let me understand thoroughly: in fact, life is a kind of strong.
